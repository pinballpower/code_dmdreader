# DMDReader

DMDReader is a software that reads the pinball DMD data provided in different formats including inputs from a real DMD (using https://github.com/pinballpower/code_dmd).
To use in in a real pinball a Raspberry Pi and a small add-on board is required. However, the software is not limited to the Raspberry Pi. 
It also runs on Windows. This is especially helpful if you want to test a colorisation from a dump file.

## License
The license has been changed from MIT to GPL v3 on 2.5.2022. In general, I'm not a big fan of the GPL and rather prefer the more open MIT license. 
However, in similar products open source software has been used to create close-source software that should replace existing open-source software. 
To make sure that won't happen with this software, the license of this software has been changed to GPL v3. Just to clarify: That doesn't mean 
anything about "commercial" or "non-commercial" use cases. If you want to create a commercial product based on this software, feel free to do so. 
If you want to sell compiled versions of this software, you can do this as long as you provide users a way to access the full source code that's 
needed to build their own software. This is also valid for any derivate work.
